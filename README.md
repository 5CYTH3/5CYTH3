# üßã  Hello guys, I'm @5CYTH3
I am mostly focused on system-programming such as programming languages, low level system interfaces.

I also have quite a lot of experience with [SvelteKit](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit) on the front-end and [go-fiber](https://github.com/gofiber/fiber) and [rocket.rs](https://github.com/rwf2/Rocket) on the back-end.

I also played quite a bit with [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) during my free time.


Mathematics and Theoretical Computer Science enthusiast! (actually working on [a programming language](https://github.com/5CYTH3/karm_parser)) <br>
Haskell, OCaml, Rust ‚ù§Ô∏è
